<h3>Flying-Cicada</h3></center>
<ul>
    <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
    <li>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li>
    <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>
